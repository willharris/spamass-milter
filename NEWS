0.3.2: (2011-02-10)
 * Fix security vulnerability with the -x option

0.3.1: (2006-03-23)
 * Ensure wrapped headers always use LF (fix for spamassassin 3.1.1)
 * Mimic sendmail's Received header even better.  Logs a warning
   to syslog if it can't fetch a sendmail macro that would help.

0.3.0: (2005-02-03)
 * -M option which disables all message modifications
 * Fixed crash on spam with no body at all
 * -e option to pass full recipient email address to spamc
 * -x option to expand recipient list with sendmail -bv
 * -f truly daemonizes now, instead of simply forking
 * -P option to create a pidfile
 * Supports both Spamassassin 2.x and 3.0 X-Spam-Status: headers
 * Fixed possible crash when a fork() call fails

0.2.0: (2003-06-26)
 * -b/-B options to redirect tagged messages to another email address.
 * -i option to not run spamassassin on messages coming from specified
   networks.
 * All arguments after -- will get passed to spamc (deprecate -D at the
   same time).
 * Envelope, remote IP, HELO, and date get sent to spamc, so the
   results more closely match what spamc via procmail sees.  A lot of
   SA rules could never fire because this data was missing. You will
   need to add a line to your sendmail config file to enable date
   passing (see README).
 * A compatible manpage is generated on systems without mdoc macros.
 * Incoming messages with absolutely no headers at all now get checked
   correctly

0.1.3a: (2002-12-31)
 * Fixed hanging problem when processing a message with no headers at
   all.  Sort of serious, so it gets its own release.

0.1.3: (2002-12-27)
 * -m option disables body, Subject:, and Content-Type: header
   modification.
 * -r option tells sendmail to reject the message if it exceeds a given
   score.
 * -u option passes recipient username to spamc.
 * Fixed illegal use of freed memory causing message loss on some
   platforms.
 * Fixed header doubling problem, and cleaned up the case where
   incoming messages already have X-Spam* headers
 * Updated RPM files.

0.1.2: (2002-08-18)
 * Many portability fixes.  Should build on any *BSD, Linux, Solaris,
   or Tru64 box, with any milter-compatible sendmail, with any
   compiler.
 * Fixed the "250K deadlock" bug.
 * Subject and Content-Types headers are only replaced if they changed. 
   This makes /var/log/maillog a bit cleaner for servers that get mail
   that has already been run through SpamAssassin.  The mail is still
   checked, so you can't bypass anything by adding SA headers.
 * Added SpamAssassin field "X-Spam-Level".
 * Added a manpage.
 * Added RedHat spec files.
 * -f option forks the milter into the background.
 * -d debugging option.

0.1.1: (2002-01-31)
 * Added SpamAssassin 2.0+ field "X-Spam-Checker-Version"
 * Changed behaviour as follows:
   - Old (already present) "X-Spam" fields are passed to SpamAssassin again,
     now it is up to SpamAssassin to make sure its not being lied to by 
     Spammers. 
   - Only mail that was previously marked being no Spam will get modified.
     Reported Spam will remain unchanged.

0.1.0: (2002-01-16)
 * First release. What do you expect? :-)
